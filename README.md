# Information Value
This is the repository for the EMNLP 2023 paper: 

**Information Value: Measuring Utterance Predictability as Distance from Plausible Alternatives**  
Mario Giulianelli, Sarenne Wallbridge, and Raquel Fern√°ndez  

We provide the code for each set of experiments in the paper (see `code/notebooks`), as well as for generating the alternative sets used throughout the paper (`scripts/generate`).  The alternatives themselves consist of 1.3M generations; we publish them [here](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10006413).
