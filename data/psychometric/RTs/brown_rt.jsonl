To silence extremists, to warn the Axis, President Roosevelt issued this statement for the Allies in August: \"From time to time since the present war began there have been reports that one or more of the Axis powers were seriously contemplating use of poisonous gas or noxious gases or other inhumane devices of warfare. I have been loath to believe that any nation, even our present enemies, could or would be willing to loose upon mankind such terrible and inhumane weapons. \"However, evidence that the Axis powers are making significant preparations indicative of such an intention is being reported with increasing frequency from a variety of sources. \"Use of such weapons has been outlawed by the general opinion of civilized mankind. This country has not used them, and I hope that we never will be compelled to use them. I state categorically that we shall under no circumstances resort to the use of such weapons unless they are first used by our enemies.\" The following month the invasion of Italy was begun, and Roosevelt gave effect to his warning by consenting to the stockpiling of poison gas in southern Italy. Bari was chosen as a depot, not only for its seeming safety, but because of its proximity to airfields. Any retaliatory gas attack would be airborne. It would be made in three waves -- the first to lay down a smokescreen, the second to drop the gas bombs, the third to shower incendiaries which would burn everything below. So the vile cargo went into the hole of the John Harvey. A detachment of six men from the 701st Chemical Maintenance Company under First Lt. Howard D. Beckstrom went aboard, followed by Lt. Thomas H. Richardson, the Cargo Security Officer. Secrecy was paramount. Only a few other people -- very important people -- knew of the nitrogen-mustard eggs nestled below decks. No one else must know.","target":"Thus, in the immemorial way -- in the way of the right hand that knows and the left that does not -- was the stage set for tragedy at Bari."}

A fresh breeze saluted him. Six o'clock! He put his head out. There was the slate roof of the church; ivy climbed the red brick walls like a green-scaled monster. The clock which had struck presented an innocent face. In the kitchen Mama was wiping the cupboards. \"There's a tower and a steeple on the church a million feet high. And the loudest clock in the whole world!\" \"I know, Stephen,\" she smiled. \"They say that our steeple is one hundred and sixty-two feet high. The clock you heard strike -- it's really the town clock -- was installed last April by Mrs. Shorter, on her birthday.\" He dressed, and sped outdoors. He crossed Broome Street to Orange Square. The steeple leaned backward, while the church advanced like a headless creature in a long, shapeless coat. The spire seemed to hold up the sky.

Part of it was being so tired -- I'd not only had my usual full day yesterday, but a dinner meeting as well, that kept me up late. But the rest of it, the main part, wasn't based on logic at all. It was just going to be one of those days. For the thousandth time, I wished I'd chosen some nice, nine-to-five, five-days-a-week profession. And for the thousandth time, I answered myself. I hadn't chosen medicine -- it had chosen me. Actually, I shouldn't complain, I told myself in the shaving mirror. I had a lot to be thankful for. A profession that brought me as good an income as mine wasn't to be sneezed at. Maybe I didn't see as much of Gladdy as I'd like, but how much worse it would have been if I'd had to board her out somewhere after Alice went -- send my daughter to an orphanage or a boarding-home. At least, we were together and we had Mrs. Hodges, bless her, to look after us -- no mother could be fonder of Gladdy than Mrs. Hodges was. I was lucky in lots of ways, no doubt about it. Especially in the way Gladdy had turned out. Growing up without a mother from the time she was three -- it wasn't a good thing for a child, even knowing the kind of mother Alice had been. But I mustn't start on Alice. She is a closed book, a picture I keep on my bureau, but never look at. If she'd kept on as she'd been going, the story I'd told Gladdy would probably have been true by now, anyhow... As usual, Gladdy's bright smile greeted me at the breakfast table. Her first class wasn't until ten, but she always got up to have breakfast with me. It made me feel good and knowing that she'd decided, all on her own, to go to college right here in town made me feel good, too. Oh, I knew that I couldn't give myself all the credit for her decision. I had a feeling that young Pete Michelson, the most promising intern at Fairview, had something to do with it, too. She'd been out with Pete the night before and her gay chatter about their date lightened my mood a little. But once I was alone again, driving to the hospital, the heaviness returned. If she and Pete were really getting serious, I'd have to do some hard thinking. Should I tell him the truth about Alice?","target":"Did he have a right to know the secret I'd kept from Gladdy all these years?"}

Each time his objective had been the same -- a direct water passage from Western Europe to the Far East. In 1607 and 1608, the English Muscovy Company had sent him northward to look for a route over the North Pole or across the top of Russia. Twice he had failed, and the Muscovy Company indicated it would not back him again. In 1609, the Dutch East India Company hired Hudson, gave him two learned geographers, fitted him out with a ship called the Half Moon, and supplied him with Dutch sailors. This time he turned westward, to the middle Atlantic coast of North America. His chief discovery was important -- the Great North (later, the Hudson) River -- but it produced no northwest passage. When the Half Moon put in at Dartmouth, England, in the fall of 1609, word of Hudson's findings leaked out, and English interest in him revived. The government forbade Hudson to return to Amsterdam with his ship. He thereupon went to London and spent the winter talking to men of wealth. By springtime, he was supported by a rich merchant syndicate under the patronage of Henry, Prince of Wales. He had obtained and provisioned a veteran ship called the Discovery and had recruited a crew of twenty-one, the largest he had ever commanded.","target":"The purpose of this fourth voyage was clear."}

She carried, besides her captain, a crew of twenty-one and provisions for a voyage of exploration of the Arctic waters of North America. Seventeen months later, on September 6, 1611, an Irish fishing boat sighted the Discovery limping eastward outside Galway Bay. When she reached port, she was found to have on board only eight men, all near starvation. The captain was gone, and the mate was gone. The man who now commanded her had started the voyage as an ordinary seaman. What disaster struck the Discovery during those seventeen months? What happened to the fourteen missing men? These questions have remained one of the great sea mysteries of all time. For hundreds of years, the evidence available consisted of (1) the captain's fragmentary journal, (2) a highly prejudiced account by one of the survivors, (3) a note found in a dead man's desk on board, and (4) several second-hand reports. All told, they offered a highly confused picture. But since 1927, researchers digging into ancient court records and legal files have been able to find illuminating pieces of information. Not enough to do away with all doubts, but sufficient to give a fairly accurate picture of the events of the voyage. Historians have had two reasons for persisting so long in their investigations. First, they wanted to clarify a tantalizing, bizarre enigma. Second, they believed it important to determine the fate of the captain -- a man whose name is permanently stamped on our maps, on American towns and counties, on a great American river, and on half a million square miles of Arctic seas. The name: Henry Hudson. This is the story of his last tragic voyage, as nearly as we are able -- or ever, probably, will be able -- to determine: The sailing in the spring of 1610 was Hudson's fourth in four years. Each time his objective had been the same -- a direct water passage from Western Europe to the Far East. In 1607 and 1608, the English Muscovy Company had sent him northward to look for a route over the North Pole or across the top of Russia. Twice he had failed, and the Muscovy Company indicated it would not back him again. In 1609, the Dutch East India Company hired Hudson, gave him two learned geographers, fitted him out with a ship called the Half Moon, and supplied him with Dutch sailors. This time he turned westward, to the middle Atlantic coast of North America. His chief discovery was important -- the Great North (later, the Hudson) River -- but it produced no northwest passage. When the Half Moon put in at Dartmouth, England, in the fall of 1609, word of Hudson's findings leaked out, and English interest in him revived. The government forbade Hudson to return to Amsterdam with his ship. He thereupon went to London and spent the winter talking to men of wealth. By springtime, he was supported by a rich merchant syndicate under the patronage of Henry, Prince of Wales. He had obtained and provisioned a veteran ship called the Discovery and had recruited a crew of twenty-one, the largest he had ever commanded. The purpose of this fourth voyage was clear. A century of exploration had established that a great land mass, North and South America, lay between Europe and the Indies. One by one, the openings in the coast that promised a passage through had been explored and discarded. In fact, Hudson's sail up the Great North River had disposed of one of the last hopes. But there remained one mysterious, unexplored gap, far to the north. Nearly twenty-five years before, Captain John Davis had noted, as he sailed near the Arctic Circle, \"a very great gulf, the water whirling and roaring, as it were the meeting of tides.\" He named this opening, between Baffin Island and Labrador, the \"Furious Overfall.\" (Later, it was to be called Hudson Strait.) In 1602, George Waymouth, in the same little Discovery that Hudson now commanded, had sailed 300 miles up the strait before his frightened men turned the ship back. Hudson now proposed to sail all the way through and test the seas beyond for the long-sought waterway. Even Hudson, experienced in Arctic sailing and determined as he was, must have had qualms as he slid down the Thames. Ahead were perilous, ice-filled waters.","target":"On previous voyages, it had been in precisely such dangerous situations that he had failed as a leader and captain."}
